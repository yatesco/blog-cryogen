## Welcome

Hi there, and come on in!

## Who?

Colin Yates is a professional Software Engineer with over 20 years experience both learning how (and just as often how not) to build software in a professional way.

## What?

This blog will be primarily technically focused, but may occasionally cover other subjects. In particular:

- Software Engineering (process, tooling, coding etc.)
- Christianity
- Family
- Whatever else springs to my disorganised mind

## Why?

Well, only you can answer why you are here, but I hope you find something interesting. For me, I am doing this to expose my inner thoughts for scrutiny in the name of personal growth!

## Where else do you ramble on?
